# Robopunks
A demo NFT minting site where you can connect with Metamask and test ethers to mint NFTs. A user can mint up to 3 NFTs. This website was created for learning purpose, therefore, it lacks best practices ðŸ˜….

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.
